Hi All,

Quick update and agenda for tomorrow's meeting:

1 - Don't use variable length arrays, e.g.
    size_t bufsize = 64;
    char *buf[bufsize];

2 - sprintf does not appear to be thread safe.  Since all the printf
related routines use the same infrastructure, all the stdio is
probably not thread safe.

3 - to address 2 I have a light weight library for building up
formatted strings.  So far this has not caused my test environment
to crash.  We have to find places where xprintf appears and convert
them.

4 - I've built a shell script that inspects the .map file from a build
for the presence of symbols that indicate that these problems are present.
It's easy to add extra tests.

5 - We should be OK using the TI libc provided that we inspect the
code, and are careful about what parts we use.

6 - We need to talk about the serial monitoring interface. It needs
some hardware.

7 - We need to talk about code reviews.

8 - I should upload my repo to the proper location in git hub.  What I'd like 
to do is start building a reference repo for the two boards:
    the R5 TMS570LC43xx board
    the R4 TMS570LS12x/RM46 LaunchPad
It would contain all the working features so far.  For example SPI, SD
card, CAN, CSP, etc.  I'm not sure what the best way to manage this is -
a shared codebase for 2 (or more) distinct architectures is tricky.

9 - near term tasks?
